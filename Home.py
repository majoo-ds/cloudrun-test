        ### Sources of Data
        We are working to add more data in the future so we can gather the insightful information from this dashboard. But for this 
        developoment, we have collected several data below 
        - __Ads Library__
        Data from this source is gathered using scraping tools to fetch our and competitor's campaigns running on Meta inc platform (Facebook, Instagram). To update the data, we need to manually scrap whenever we need to. (e.g: weekly)
        - __Social Media__
        By fetching instagram's profiles of our competitors via Graph API, we gain insight about their engagement on Instagram platform. The data shown is real time and updated automatically in daily basis. But for limitation and following instagram's rules, we just can fetch data for the last 2 weeks and data is delayed up to 48 hours.
        - __E-commerce__
        Until now, we've gathered competitor's official account on Tokopedia only where they run promotional sales programs regularly, so we can analyze what are best products/services they've sold and in which prices. Similar to Ads Library data, we need to update it regularly using scraping tools (e.g: weekly)
